# Algo Invest Trade

## Description:
Project 7 OpenClassrooms Path - AlgoInvest&amp;Trade -- develop an algorithm to solve a problem

We need you to design an algorithm that will maximise the profit made by our clients after two years 
of investment. Your algorithm must suggest a list of the most profitable stocks that we should buy 
to maximise a client's profit after two years.

## 1st part - bruteforce algorithm:
We have the following conditions:
- Each share can only be purchased once.
- We cannot buy a fraction of a share.
- We can spend a maximum of 500 euros per customer.


## 2nd part - optimization of the bruteforce algorithm:
The programme must provide an answer in less than one second. I have created two algorithms, one
greedy algorithm and a branch and bound algorithm.
Add share datasets of 1000 shares, cleaned the datasets before usage with pandas library. 


## Installation: 
open terminal

1. `git clone https://github.com/DoriDoro/algoInvest_trade.git`
2. `cd alogInvest_trade`
3. `python3 main.py`


### Skills:
- Deconstructing a problem
- Developing an algorithm to solve a problem

# Algo Invest Trade

## Description:
Project 7 OpenClassrooms Path - AlgoInvest&amp;Trade -- develop an algorithm to solve a problem


## 1st part - bruteforce algorithm:
We need you to design an algorithm that will maximise the profit made by our clients after two years 
of investment. Your algorithm must suggest a list of the most profitable stocks that we should buy 
to maximise a client's profit after two years.

We have the following conditions:
- Each share can only be purchased once.
- We cannot buy a fraction of a share.
- We can spend a maximum of 500 euros per customer.
